Hi Orrando,

It's my pleasure to communicate with you again.

Yet again you have tirelessly spent time and effort concocting a unique, informative, helpful and empathetic message to help me through this quite traumatic experience.

When I purchase a product with a replacement warranty that is not honoured then I would expect to feel betrayed and rejected.  I might be wary of purchasing other products in case the entire retail industry has degenerated into this postapocalyptic world where after purchase you are just left entirely to your own devices in the case of a manufacturing defect (pardon the pun Orrando).

In your capable hands however, I continue to receive the emotional support that I need to get through this period of intense sorrow.  With the passage of time and your continued support, I may be able to purchase a new reading device without the paralysing fear that it will stop working for no reason and that a replacement would not be forthcoming.

I wish you all the best and look forward to speaking with you again soon.

Hi Orrando,

I appreciate the time and effort you put into these responses.

You are no doubt very busy talking to people about the issues they are experiencing with their kobo devices and yet still find the time to reminisce with me about this warranty issue that I feared you might otherwise have forgotten.

There is a very high bar set for customer service theses days and I can tell that you are not the sort of person who might shirk their responsibilities.

You are up there with the best of them so if you ever require a personal reference or recommendation then I would do so without hesitation.

On this matter however - perhaps we have to agree to disagree - or at least disagree to agree.  There was no physical damage to the device.  It was within the warranty period.  It was not replaced.

Thank you for allowing me to accept this ongoing service.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for responding. We understand that you would like to have the device replaced by us here at Kobo, but as per our warranty policy once the device shows signs of physically damage we cannot or at no time replace that specific device.
 
We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

Yes - I suppose you believe that this matter is closed and i will somehow continue to make use of kobo's online book store despite the worthless and ineffectual warranty on this device. 

I look forward to your next dismissive response.

I will repeat once more that the device was defective and not physically damaged. 

It is ridiculous to claim that 'diagonal lines indicate physical damage' as you told me on the phone. There is no evidence of physical damage - your policy is simply to invent excuses to avoid upholding a warranty. 

My only option is just to dispose of the device and never waste my time with a kobo product again. 

Appalling customer service like this is risky - I am likely to replace my ereaders every few years and am now 
never going to consider purchasing a kobo device because I do not believe that you would be willing to repair or replace it if it was faulty. 

Your apology for 'any trouble this may cause' is not accepted.

None of the suggestions have addressed the issue - the screen component is just broken as you can see from the photographs. 
You claimed that the problem was caused by physical damage when it was not. 

I experienced exactly the same screen malfunction with a kindle device a few years ago and it was replaced immediately by amazon after a single phone call. 

If replacement of this device is also not provided by kobo within the warranty then I will simply throw the device away, buy a kindle, never purchase a kobo product again and recommend the same to my friends and family.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for contacting Kobo Customer Care.  We are sorry to hear that you are experiencing problems with your Kobo eReader. You were advised that we will not be able to provide a replacement for your eReader because it shows signs of physical damage. I'm sorry for any trouble this may cause.
 
I told you that I'll be sending you an email with some troubleshooting steps for you to give a try and once completed we would like to know the result whether or not they were successful.

Listed below are a few steps that we would like you to first try to resolve the issue.

A basic reset forces your eReader to restart properly. In many cases, this action is enough to restore your eReader to working order.

Before attempting these steps, ensure your eReader has been charged for a minimum of 1 hour.

To perform a basic reset:

1. Turn off your eReader, if possible, by holding down the power button for 5 seconds.
2. Locate the reset hole on your eReader.  It is the small hole located on either the back or bottom edge of your device.  If you own a Kobo Mini, you will have to remove the Snap Back to locate the hole which is by the printed model number.
3. Unfold a paperclip and slide an end into the hole.
4. Press gently until you feel a click. Your eReader should restart.

If you are still not able to turn the device back on you can move on to the next set of troubleshooting steps that may apply.

Complete a Factory Reset
Warning: a factory reset on a Kobo Glo returns the device to its 'out-of-the-box' condition - all updates, documents, and books will be deleted - however, a sync will restore the Kobo Library

Factory reset on a responsive device:

1.Press the Home icon
2.Tap the Settings icon (three lines, upper right)
3.Tap Settings
4.Tap Device Information
5.Tap FACTORY RESET
6.Tap RESET NOW
7.Synchronize your eReader
8.Factory reset on a non-responsive device:
9.Ensure that the device is powered off
10.Press and hold the Light button
11.Slide the power switch to the right, hold for one second, let go of the switch
12.Continue to hold the Light button until the small light to the left of the power switch flashes
13.Let go of the Light button
14.Synchronize your reader

If these steps do not work to resolve the issue please contact us.
